## ABOUT THE DATASET
### Context
A central purpose of The _Human Freedom Index_ is to paint a broad but reasonably accurate picture of the extent of overall freedom in the world. A larger purpose is to more carefully explore what we mean by freedom and to better understand its relationship to any number of other social and economic phenomena.

### Content
The _Human Freedom Index_ measures economic freedoms such as the freedom to trade or to use sound money, and it captures the degree to which people are free to enjoy the major freedoms often referred to as civil liberties—freedom of speech, religion, association, and assembly— in the countries in the survey. In addition, it includes indicators on rule of law, crime and violence, freedom of movement, and legal discrimination against same-sex relationships. We also include five variables pertaining to women-specific freedoms that are found in various categories of the index.

- `HFI2020.csv` contains the data used for the project.
- `cleaning.py` is the script for cleaning and analyzing the HFI data.
- `variableimporter.py` is the script used to arrange the data in a suitable format for Adobe Illustrator.
- `finalClean.py` is the script with some final touches for the `csv` file created with `variableimporter.py`.

## How to run it?
First run `cleaning.py`, followed by `variableimporter.py` and `finalClean.py`.
